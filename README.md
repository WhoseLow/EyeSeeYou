# EyeSeeYou
Art project for a friend of mine. Uses opencv to track faces and draw an eyeball to be staring at them. So far it is quite quick and dirty, and I want to say I'll get around to cleaning it up but that's probably not true. I'm still proud of it as it's the first large-ish project I've taken on after nothing but an intro to c++ course.

## Dependencies
- opencv
- sdl2
- cmake

## Binaries
- Binary compiled for my machine is included in the repository
